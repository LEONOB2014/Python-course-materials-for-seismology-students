# seismology_tools
a library of various tools and notebooks for catalog analysis

I built these tools to analyze the JMA catalog. It includes some notebooks that describe how to make various plots in python. I don't make any promises because I haven't written many tests for these functions.

# stuff this collection of tools does

1. calculate statistics for catalogs (b-value, a-value, etc)
2. plots different things like frequency magnitude diagrams, maps, etc.
3. selects data from the catalog so you can calculate summary statistics for sub events

I hope this is useful to someone.
